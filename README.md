## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Analyze and predict migration trends (arrivals and departures) using ML models.
- **Data Source:** Historical migration data including `Measure`, `Country`, `Citizenship`, `Year`, and `Value`.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
  - Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
  - Regression & Classification Modeling
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
  - Clustering and Unsupervised Learning

##  Features & Highlights

-  **Visualizations**: Line plots, bar charts, and stacked graphs to analyze trends by year, country, and citizenship.
-  **ML Models**:
  - Regression: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor
  - Classification: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree
  - Clustering: Agglomerative Clustering with Hierarchical Dendrogram
-  **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA used for visualizing data patterns in lower dimensions.
-  **Model Evaluation**: Used RÂ² Score, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
-  **Modular Design**: Cleanly separated notebook/code sections for EDA, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.
